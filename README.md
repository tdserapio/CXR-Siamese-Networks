# CXR-Siamese-Networks
An attempt to use siamese networks to check whether there is a change or not in a before-and-after sequence of CXRs.

Here's a way to think of siamese networks:

Note that the loss function that is more commonly used is **Cross-Entropy Loss**, but Binary-Entropy Loss isn't too bad in performance either.
